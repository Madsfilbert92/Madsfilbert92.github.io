	<h2>Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
	<h3>Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</h3>
	<p>The jitter plot is like a dot plot(a placement of datapoints on an axis) except you "jitter" 
		the points in order to distinguish points which have the same value from each other.
	</p>
	<h3>Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3.</h3>
		Figure 2-3 illustrates how the choice of alignment can change the appearence of the histogram. 
		when changing the alignment the interval of numbers that should be put in the bin changes, so 
		the number of observations in the bin might change and thereby change the histogram. In other 
		words a histogram is not unique.
	<h3>When can KDEs be misleading?</h3>
		KDEs are misleading if you have discrete data where there are no trends in the data. 
		A KDE estimates a continous function, but if your data is discrete this can be 
		misleading. Furthermore it assumes that your data 
		has some kind of trends, but you can not be sure of this before you explore the data.
	<h3>Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms or KDEs". What does he mean by that?</h3>
		Because you no longer look at how much data is a given point, but how much is up to this point, 
		which can be harder to comprehend.
	<h3>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</h3>
		It is a CDF but where the x and y axis has switch place. With this you can easily make read as 
		"x% of the data occurs in y or less". With the example from the book "x% of the requests are responded in less than y seconds"
	<h3>How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</h3>
		
	<h3>Explain why one has to be careful when using mean, median, and related summary statistics</h3>
	<h3>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</h3>
	<h3>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</h3>
