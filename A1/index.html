	<h2>Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
	<h3>Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</h3>
	<p>The jitter plot is like a dot plot(a placement of datapoints on an axis) except you "jitter" 
		the points in order to distinguish points which have the same value from each other.
	</p>
	<h3>Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3.</h3>
	<p>Figure 2-3 illustrates how the choice of alignment can change the appearence of the histogram. 
		when changing the alignment the interval of numbers that should be put in the bin changes, so 
		the number of observations in the bin might change and thereby change the histogram. In other 
		words a histogram is not unique.</p>
	<h3>When can KDEs be misleading?</h3>
	<p>	KDEs are misleading if you have discrete data where there are no trends in the data. 
		A KDE estimates a continous function, but if your data is discrete this can be 
		misleading. Furthermore it assumes that your data 
		has some kind of trends, but you can not be sure of this before you explore the data.</p>
	<h3>Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms or KDEs". What does he mean by that?</h3>
	<p>	Because you no longer look at how much data is a given point, but how much is up to this point, 
		which can be harder to comprehend.</p>
	<h3>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</h3>
	<p>	It is a CDF but where the x and y axis has switch place. With this you can easily make read as 
		"x% of the data occurs in y or less". With the example from the book "x% of the requests are responded in less than y seconds"</p>
	<h3>How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</h3>
	<p>The probability plot is defined by x_i=μ+σ&Phi;^−1(y_i) where μ is the mean, σ is the variance and σ&Phi;^−1 is 
		the inverse of the gaussian cumulative distribution. From this function we can se that if 
		we plot the probability plot the points should approximate a straight line with slope σ and intercept at 
		μ if the data is distributed according to a gaussian distribution.
		The probability plot is used to confirm whether the data follows a gaussian distribution.</p>
	<h3>Explain why one has to be careful when using mean, median, and related summary statistics</h3>
	<p>mean, median and other summary statistics only make sense to interpret if the data is distributed according 
		to an unimodal distribution. Summary statistics may be very misleading if this is not fulfilled. Consider an 
		example where the distribution has two "peaks" then you will probably get a mean that is somewhere between the peaks 
		but you usually interpret the mean as the central tendency in the data but this is not really true if it placed between 
		the two peaks.</p> 
	<h3>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</h3>
	<p>Box plots have a lot of different information in them, such as outliers, median, the inter-quartile range and outliers. It is 
		especially useful when you start out your data exploration. You can easily get a sense if the data is symmetric, and how the data is distributed between 
		the head and the tail and you can spot outliers. Furthermore you can use boxplots to compare distribution between different datasets such that 
		you can find out which one you want to investigate further.</p>
	<h3>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</h3>
	<p>When you use a box plot there is some loss of data i.e. you can't see the distribution of the data. The violin plots make 
		up for this by not only having the same information as box plots but also showing the distribution of the data. Thereby 
		you can also get a better of data that does not have a unimodal distribution. However they may not be as good for 
		explanatory data visualisation as not many people know them. You therefore have to make a good description of the plot if you 
		want to use it for communication.</p>

	<h2>Part 2: DAOST Chapter 3 Questions</h2>
	<h3>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?</h3>
	<p>Looking at the plot it looks like the data follows some sort of function or system without having points that differ from this not even with a 
	small displacement of a point.</p>  
	<h3>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</h3>
	<p>A real world example of multivariat realtionship could be a relationship between age and the weight of a human being. 
	Age could be related a little with weight of humans because when they grow older they become bigger but other 
	factors such as nutrition and gender also plays a role.</p>
	<h3>What are the two methods Janert metions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?</h3>
	<p>Janert mentions weighted splines and LOESS. You could also use a moving average or a weighted moving average(which is a special case of LOESS)</p>
	<h3>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</h3>
	<p>A residual is the difference between your smoothed approximation and the actual data. It gives you an idea 
		of how well the smoothing actually fits the data. If your model is good the residuals should be balanced and they should 
		be free of trends(Else you can correct your smoothing according to the trend to make it better). 
	</p>
	<h3>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</h3>
	<p> After creating your smoothing, you make two sets of datapoints, those with negative residuals and does with positive 
	residuals. Now you create a smoothing over each of these two datasets. You know have a band in which the majority of 
	points lie. With this we can spot potential outliers i.e. points outside the band.</p>
	<h3>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</h3>
	<p>It will help you discover if there is a exponential relationship between the x- and y-axis. On a semi-log plot 
	an exponential realtionship will become linear. Thereby you can easily read-off the relative change in the data.</p>
	<h3>What kind of functions will loglog plots help you see?</h3>
	<p>With loglog plots power-law relationships become linear. That is if both x- and y-axis span many orders of magnitude.</p>
	<h3>What the h#ll is banking and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</h3>
	<p>Humans are best at seing change at approximately 45 degrees. Banking scales the aspect rations such that the 
	slopes become approximately 45 degrees. Banking is not very useful if the data is to skewed. You simply can not 
	correct the slopes. Furthermore the human eye prefer formats of roughly 4 by 3, therefore banked graphs can 
	become "uneasy" on the eye.</p>
	<h3>I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it?</h3>
	<p>There is asymmetry between two variables i.e. you get different solution if you regress y on x or x on y. 
	Therefore linear regression is not a best fit but a best predictor.</p>
	<h3>Summarize the discussion of Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics on pp. 68-69 in your own words.</h3>
	<p>Graphical analysis is also known as exploratory data visualisation. It is used to gain knowledge about a dataset. 
	When doing graphical analysis you want to make it easy to iterate several amounts of time therefore you do 
	not concern yourself that much about labels, legends and other things that makes the graph prettier.
	Presentation graphics is also known as explanatory data visualisation. In creating presentation graphics you want 
	to communicate results and knowledge about the data that you already know. Make sure to make the graphics easy to understand and 
	explain them such that a new viewer can gain knowledge.</p>
